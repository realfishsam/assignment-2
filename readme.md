# Questions
What is the range of load and time during operation for each manufacturer?
q1: What is the most expected load value?
q2: How are the load and time related?
q3: Which distribution best describes the load?
q4: Which distribution best describes the time?
q5: Which manufacturer has the best performance and why?

# Answers

1. **Range of load and time**:
   - Manufacturer A: Load [67.77, 80.54], Time [15.28, 44.28]
   - Manufacturer B: Load [68.36, 80.17], Time [10.88, 35.42]
   - Manufacturer c: Load [68.89, 82.35], Time [4.52, 24.30]

q1: The most expected load value is approximately 74.52

q2: Load and time are negatively correlated (-0.58). As load increases, time decreases.

q3: The load follows a Normal distribution*

q4: The time follows a Gamma distribution.

q5: Manufacturer 'c' has the best performance using the given metrics. It has the lowest average time (12.70s) for a similar average load (~74.4), resulting in the highest efficiency.
